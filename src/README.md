# Conection.ahk
Monitors your internet connection and attempts to reconnect to your network if the connection fail.

Setup:
1. Your Settings.ini must include a section titled "[Network]". For example:
```
    [Network]
    Network="My wifi name"
```

# Window.ahk
Monitors which window is active and performs 3 functions:
            
1. Suspend any scripts that it is baby sitting if a window in the Suspend Group becomes active.
2. Reloads any scripts that it is baby sitting if that script was editted.
3. Forces any window in Settings.ini to maintain it's x, y, width and height (unless it is maximized or Ctrl is held).

Setup:
1. For any scripts that you want Window.ahk to babysit, they must have the following code in them:
```ã€€
    OnMessage(0xFF, "StatusReport")
    
    StatusReport(wParmam := "") {
        If (wParam == 1) {
            ;Optional code to make any changes after being told to suspend/unsuspend.
        }
        Else
            Return, (A_IsSuspended)
    }
```
   and a list of scripts to monitor (you can ommit the extension) separated with "|" in your Settings.ini:
```
    [Scripts]
    Scripts="Script1|Script2|...|ScriptN"
```
2. Your Settings.ini file must include a section titled "[Window Positions]". For example:
```
    [Window Positions]
    7zFM.exe=-7, 730, 894, 357
    Calculator.exe=-7, 0, 336, 541
    Camera.exe=-7, 0, 871, 541

    hh.exe=-7, 730, 894, 357
